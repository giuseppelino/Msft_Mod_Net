# Running a legacy ASP.NET MVC app as-is on GKE Windows

This sample walks through a complete tutorial of running [Contoso University](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application) on Google Kubernetes Engine in a Windows Container.  This app is a traditional Microsoft ASP.NET Framework MVC + Entity Framework sample that was built with .NET Framework 4.5 and EntityFramework 6.  We also leverage [Cloud SQL for SQL Server](https://cloud.google.com/sql-server) a managed Microsoft SQL Server 2017 database in Google Cloud.

## Prerequisites

1. Visual Studio 2019 â€“ (Community Edition or any edition)

1. (Optional) [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) on your local machine.  Don't worry if you cannot install Docker in your environment, we have a solution for you!

1. Download and install the Google Cloud SDK following these [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) or clone this repo.

## Setup

[Download the original Microsoft sample](https://webpifeed.blob.core.windows.net/webpifeed/Partners/ASP.NET%20MVC%20Application%20Using%20Entity%20Framework%20Code%20First.zip) and unzip it to a local directory, or clone this repository and checkout the `start` tag.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/jjdelorme/ContosoUniversity

git checkout start
```

Open `ContosoUniversity.sln` with Visual Studio 2019.

### Setup Cloud SQL for SQL Server

Start by setting up the Google Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance.  You can [create an instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/create-instance?hl=en_US>), [set up the DB](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/create-manage-databases?hl=en_US>) and [add a user](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/create-manage-users?hl=en_US) to connect to the database.  For the purposes of this tutorial you can use the SQL Server 2017 Express Edition which has $0 licensing costs.  Make sure that the IP you will be connecting to the database from is added to the [Authorized networks](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/configure-ip?hl=en_US#console). 
As soon as you have that setup, make a note of the SQL server IP address, user and password. 

### Connect to the database

Using the Cloud SQL Server IP address, database name, user and password you created above, modify your connection string in the `Web.config` file:

```XML
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="SchoolContext" connectionString="Data Source=1.1.1.1;Initial Catalog=ContosoUniversity;User ID=sqlserver;Password=XXXXX;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
  </connectionStrings>
```

Further down in your `Web.config` file, find the `<entityFramework>` section and uncomment the `<contexts .../>` node:

```XML
  <entityFramework>
      <contexts>
       <context type="ContosoUniversity.DAL.SchoolContext, ContosoUniversity">
        <databaseInitializer type="ContosoUniversity.DAL.SchoolInitializer, ContosoUniversity" />
      </context>
    </contexts>
```

### Test the application 

Confirm the application builds and functions as desired before staring the migration.  The application uses Entity Framework and an initializer will populate the database on first run if it connects succesfully.

1. From Visual Studio 2019 press `Ctrl+F5` to build and run the project. 

1. You should see the home page:
![Home Page](./_figures/homepage.png)

1. Verify it can access the database by clicking on one of the tabs, i.e. Departments.
